# Reddit-Save-Manager

Reddit has a lot of useful information on it, and if you're like me, you save A LOT of posts and comments. Unfortunately, most people don't know that Reddit only keeps track of the last ~1000 or so saved items, so when you go over that limit, your saved content gets much harder to find. This application is a personal project designed to permanently save all of your saved content by storing it in a local database on your computer.
